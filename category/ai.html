</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Due to a recent interest in AI and machine learning, I decided to learn more
about the usage of machine learning for behavioral analysis of malware. Because
many malware detection systems use heuristics to identify new and unknown
threats, it makes sense that the heuristic could be developed as a classifier
using machine learning techniques. However, there are issues that make this
use difficult. Some recent research shows promise, but machine learning is
not yet sufficient to replace current heuristic approaches.</p>
<p>In malware detection, there are two main types of detection, pattern-based
and heuristic-based. Pattern-based is very effective at catching known malware
because it knows what to look for. If we draw a parallel to catching criminals,
it's like having a photo of every known criminal and doing facial recognition
on everyone. It's effective, but only if you know who to look for. Heuristic
based systems look for certain attributes of files and watch their behavior
to decide if the file is malware. This is a good compliment to pattern matching
as it can catch previously unknown malware. However, this technique is highly
sensitive to the quality of the heuristics used. Too broad and you get false
positives, too narrow and you don't catch anything. Because the whole problem
is based on categorizing files into malware and not malware, the machine learning
algorithms known as classifiers are a perfect fit. In theory, with enough
accurate training data you can create a very accurate heuristic.</p>
<p>There are several difficulties that have made implementing these systems difficult.
One study found that using the J48 decision tree could produce an accuracy of almost
95 percent.[1] This sounds high, but modern malware detection systems need to have
near 100 percent accuracy to be useful. Considering having many hundreds of
thousands of files on a system, 95% will lead to a lot of false positives. That
results in alert flooding, which is a serious problem. If your antivirus pops
up constantly, you will either hit allow without reading the warning or remove
the utility outright.</p>
<p>One of the problems with machine learning is that there is never enough high
quality training data. The article mentioned above only used some ~550 files,
with about half being malicious. The files were all PE Windows executables.
This is not a particularly large training set, enough for research but not for
production. If we want to use machine learning for real world purposes, we will
need a much larger dataset. The data must also meet certain criteria. A study
done at the US Naval Academy found that the ratio of classes in the training
data need to be similar to what is found in the wild.[2]</p>
<p>This is contrary to the commonly held belief that the accuracy of the classifier is independent of
differences between the ratios in the training and testing data. This study
noted a drastic drop in performance when using mismatched data. The first
study used about 50/50 good and bad files for both the training and the test,
so this problem would never have come up in those tests. Another important
note is the fact that both of these studies were entirely based on the file's
metadata and header information. While this is fast and has potential to be
useful, it remains to be seen how easy it would be for malware to hide itself
behind valid and seemingly harmless metadata and headers.</p>
<p>As I consider this problem, I wonder if this problem could be blended with the
current trend towards so-called cloud computing. There are several 'cloud-based'
antivirus solutions available today. For example <a class="reference external" href="http://www.immunet.com/index">Immunet</a> is backed and hosted by
Cisco and supported by their Talos group. However, these services are using the
same techniques as traditional client-side solutions. They are simply run in
the cloud, with only file signatures generated locally. Because these services
process huge amounts of files on a constant basis, they could be a source of
a huge amount of training data for a machine learning system. For example, one
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.avira.com/en/avira-protection-cloud">service</a> boasts 200,000 new files scanned daily with 10,000 being malware.
With this much data, it seems possible to develop an accurate system.</p>
<p>This would also have its own barriers however. Most of these systems only upload files
that are suspicious, which would skew the ratio of clean to unclean files away
from the real-world case. However, if the input to the algorithm uses the same
ratio the problem will be greatly reduced. In any case, it seems unlikely that
this system would be used as a replacement for existing systems. It would most
probably be used as a supplement to existing systems, which are already quite
accurate. Existing systems already use sandbox testing and behavioral analysis,
which catches a large amount of new and unknown malware.</p>
<p>If current systems are so good, why bother with developing new techniques? The
answer lies in the fact that the number of potential attack vectors are growing
faster than security experts can keep up. With the explosion of the IoT movement,
the amount of internet connected devices will skyrocket. With it, the amount of
malware floating around will increase. Because this growth will quickly outrun
the capacity of security firms to detect and protect against, automated threat
detection and analysis systems need to be developed.</p>
<p>Some systems defend against unknown threats by enforcing mandatory access control,
which prevents any application from doing anything it shouldn't. This works, but
only as long as you can clearly define what a program is allowed to do. In addition,
this does not prevent malware from injecting itself into valid softwares and
interfering with its work.</p>
<p>All things considered, I think that the use of machine learning and AI algorithms in
anti-malware environments is needed and unavoidable. My lack of knowledge about this
topic may have led me to be overly optimistic, but I think that that can lead to new
ideas. Hopefully, the problems are solved before the malware gets ahead of us.</p>
